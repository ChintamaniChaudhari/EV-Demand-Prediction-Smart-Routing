## 🧐 Problem Statement

As the world transitions to sustainable transport, the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is rapidly increasing. This growth presents two significant challenges:
1.  **Inefficient Infrastructure Planning:** Charging stations are often placed without data-backed insights, leading to underutilization in some areas and long queues in others.
2.  **Range Anxiety:** EV drivers often worry about finding an available charging station before their battery runs out, making long-distance travel stressful.

Our project aims to solve these problems with a data-driven approach.

## 💡 Our Solution

This project is divided into two core modules:

1.  **⚡ Demand Prediction:** A machine learning model that forecasts high-demand areas and times for EV charging. This helps stakeholders make informed decisions about where to install new charging stations.
2.  **🚗 Smart Routing:** An intelligent routing algorithm that calculates the most efficient path for an EV, considering the vehicle's current battery level and the real-time/predicted availability of charging stations along the way.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Data-Driven Demand Forecasting**: Utilizes historical data to predict future charging needs.
- **Geospatial Hotspot Analysis**: Identifies optimal locations for new charging infrastructure.
- **Dynamic EV Routing**: Generates routes based on State of Charge (SoC) and destination.
- **Integrated Charging Stops**: Seamlessly adds necessary charging stops to the journey plan.
- **Reduces Range Anxiety**: Provides drivers with a reliable and optimized travel plan.

## ⚙️ Methodology

### Demand Prediction Module
1.  **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: We use a dataset of historical charging sessions. The data is cleaned, and features like time of day, day of the week, and location are engineered.
2.  **Model Training**: A time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA, or Gradient Boosting) is trained on the preprocessed data to learn demand patterns.
3.  **Forecasting & Visualization**: The trained model predicts future demand, which can be visualized on a map to highlight high-demand "hotspots."

### Smart Routing Module
1.  **Graph Representation**: The road network and charging station locations are modeled as a graph, where roads are edges and intersections/stations are nodes.
2.  **Cost Function**: We use a modified routing algorithm (like A* or Dijkstra's) with a custom cost function that considers not only distance but also the EV's battery level, charging time at stations, and station availability.
3.  **Optimal Path Calculation**: The algorithm computes the most efficient path from origin to destination, including necessary charging stops, ensuring the vehicle never runs out of charge.

🔮 Future Scope
Real-time Data Integration: Incorporate live traffic data and real-time charging station occupancy.

Web-based Interactive UI: Develop a fully interactive web application for both modules.

Mobile Application: Create a companion mobile app for drivers on the go.

Cost Optimization: Factor in electricity pricing and charging costs into the routing algorithm.

Personalization: Allow users to save their vehicle profiles and preferences.
